# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as passenger class, gender, age, and fare.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers including:
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Gender (Sex)
- Age
- Fare
- Survival Status (Survived)

The target variable is **Survived**:
- 0 → Did not survive
- 1 → Survived

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Handled missing values
3. Converted categorical data into numerical format
4. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
5. Split data into training and testing sets
6. Trained a Logistic Regression model
7. Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Algorithm Used
- Logistic Regression

## Result
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately **78–82%**, showing good performance for a beginner-level classification problem.

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, and is suitable for beginners in data science.

# Movie Rating Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a regression model that predicts movie ratings based on features such as genre, director, and actors.

## Dataset
The movie dataset includes details like:
- Genre
- Director
- Actors
- Movie Rating

The target variable is **Rating**, which represents the score given by users or critics.

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Cleaned the data and handled missing values
3. Encoded categorical features using label encoding
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
5. Built a regression model
6. Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and R² score
7. Visualized actual vs predicted ratings

## Algorithm Used
- Linear Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience with regression techniques and helps understand how different movie features influence ratings.

# Iris Flower Classification

## Objective
The objective of this project is to classify iris flowers into one of three species — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a built-in dataset in Scikit-learn and contains:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The target variable is **Species**.

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Iris dataset
2. Created a pandas DataFrame
3. Performed exploratory data analysis and visualization
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
5. Trained a classification model
6. Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Algorithm Used
- Logistic Regression

## Result
The model achieved an accuracy of **95% or higher**, demonstrating excellent classification performance.

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a classic machine learning classification problem and serves as a strong foundation for beginners in data science.
